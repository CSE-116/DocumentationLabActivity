# Documentation Lab Activity Answer Key
This repo is identical to what should be given to students, but with the furthestNode method
in ProblemSet.java completed. This should be shown to students to allow them to check their
solutions, but the given tests should be enough for them to see if they did things correctly
or not.

Note: The allShortestPathsSimple method in the tools.Graph, and the corresponding ShortestPathSimple
method, do not work entirely correctly. This is okay, as students should not be calling these methods
anyway and I really do not feel like fixing it. This should not ever come up if the students are only
using the provided test cases.
